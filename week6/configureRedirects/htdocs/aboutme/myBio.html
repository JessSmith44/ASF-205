            Oh boy, a page about me! Talk about a pain, I guess to start I am a mother to 3, the yongest two are special needs. What they
            have is classified as extremely rare, though in the turn of events I cannot bring myself to believe any statistics the doctors
            give us anymore. I am a crafter, I love drawing and crocheting, cooking and baking, singing and dancing, hiking, going for drives,
            basically a million different things, but nothing is more important or more deeply loved for hobbies than learning. I spend allot of 
            my free time pushing current knowledge past what I know and can do or learning all new things. That drive to learn and grow is what
            led me to go to Bryan University for web dev in the first place. I also elected to do so as I have always wanted to be able to learn
            coding and programming to eventually build my own game, as I enjoy gaming greatly but there are aspect I desire in games that I cannot
            seem to find all in one.
