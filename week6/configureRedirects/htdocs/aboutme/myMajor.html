            My current Major is in Web Developement. I have always found technology, coding and programming, and designing graphics to 
            be super fascinating! After some debate and allot of discussions I came to the conclusion it was time to take the plunge
            and finally go after what I want. And here I am, while there are times where I contemplate whether I made the right choice
            or not I am so glad That I am here and pushing forward through all the trials and uncertainty. I have had such a wonderful 
            journey with web dev, however HTML and CSS are by far my absolute favorite! I spend allot of free time playing with them 
            outside of school.
