            I have made so many projects, not just for school but also in my free time. Though there are many unfinished and others that 
            just need to be fixed up a bit, I am most looking forward to seeing my secret project come into fruition. I have already started 
            it with react, HTML, and CSS. But it is far from finished. I also loved working with server side using express.js and MySQL! MongoDB
            was also allot of fun towards the end when things became super clear. Intro to the DOM was a difficult class with little instructions
            but the pay out was magnificent in the end. I can say that so far that I do prefer JavaScript over Python though. Python may look as if
            it is easier, however I find JavaScript to be much more understandable. I am excited to see what else is left for course work and how 
            it can all be tied together!
