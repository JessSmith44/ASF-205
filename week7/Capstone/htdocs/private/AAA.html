        If you have made your way here, you understand the concepts at hand for this course. I have lost all creative mindset for 
        this class at this point. Docker has done everything possible to destroy me mentally. Ideally this would be the page where all 
        activity is logged, comments or anything flagged would appear here. As well as control over the main sites content and database 
        at a certain level. This would be a main point of access for the moderators. I have not set anything up for it as I am so over
        stressed at this point that this is what I can muster up enough to do.
